   Welcome to my TUI portfolio. On this webpage you can find some information about me and links 
   to projects I made. You can get this information by typing commands, at any time you can type
   the <b>HELP</b> command to get a list of all the available commands. I would definetly recomend 
   typing the <b>MILAN</b> and <b>ITEMS</b> commands.

   note: Viewing this webpage works best on a desktop, but mobile is supported.
